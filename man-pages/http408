.SH NAME
http408 \- Client Error Responses
.SH SYNOPSIS
http408 - Request Timeout
.SH DESCRIPTION
This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any
previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down
this unused connection. This response is used much more since some browsers,
like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up
surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the connection without
sending this message.
.SH OPT	IONS
